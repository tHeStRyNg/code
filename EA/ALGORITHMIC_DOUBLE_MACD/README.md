Double MACD Scalping

This expert advisor is meticulously crafted to harness the power of not just one but two MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicators.
What sets this EA apart is its sophisticated strategy that waits for two confirmation (configurable) signals from these dual MACD indicators before executing any order (upon 3rd signal).
