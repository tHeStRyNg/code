### ALGORITHMIC MA (MOVING AVERAGES) WITH 3x TF (TIMEFRAMES).
- The signals are correlated from M30 and cross related with direction to M5 and M15 for accuracy still not perfect but its interesting 
- Added % Cut Loss Prevention
- added counting of the 3 chars opened and closed positions concatenated on a dashboard
- Diff Config Sets:
- 1 - M1, M5, M15(signal) - note that lower TF are less reliable
- 2 - M5,M15 AND M30(signal)
- 3 - M15,M30,H1(signal)
