MACD RSI STORM COLOR
The idea behind this indicator was initially to be used on RSI_STORM EA that we have deveoped towards giving a more granular control of the trend direction and momentum in which, in order to correlate corretly with RSI indicator, it's required.

I have converted the indicator into a signal that can be passed and integrated to the RSI_STORM EA or you can use it your own way. It's here for you to use and abuse and we hope you enjoy the experience that it provides.
